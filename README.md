# ag-algorithm-competitions
 
A random sample of programing challenge questions concerning algorithms and data structures.
This is from my student days ~2010 and I found it in my backups folder so I am uploading it here in hopes that someone might find it beneficial and to preserve it from disapearing.

Unfortunately, many of the problems do not have a description or a link (I will try to improve this if I find the time)
Many of the problems also have missing input data as it is referencing a local directory which I no longer have.
If I ever find these files I will try to add them properly as resources :)

In any case and however incomplete this repository might be it is still better on Github then lost in my backup drive.
